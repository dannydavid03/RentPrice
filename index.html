<blockquote>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> Due to the current housing crisis
sweeping not only Madison, but the nation itself, we wanted to
investigate deeper into what the housing market looked like over the
past 2 decades. We will analyze the changes in the housing market by for
each region of the United States, across a time span of 20 years -
focusing specifically on 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, and 2023 as our years
of interest. Our main questions are- what region of the United States
has been the most expensive overall? And have housing prices seen an
abnormally rapid increase between any year in particular, in any region
in particular? <strong>Thesis:</strong> The costs of housing have
increased over the past 2 decades across the US, but there are some
regions that have been more affected than others by the national housing
crisis, especially during certain years. <strong>DATA SET</strong> The
data set was compiled from various datasets of the Office of Policy
Development and Research for each of the years mentioned above. The data
included the rent price for counties across the US, so we grouped it by
state (averaging the rent prices of all available counties in the state
and obtaining one value), and then grouped again by region doing the
same process. Our variables (in the “years” data set) are: state,
region, year, and rent. In our data set, we chose to only test 3-bedroom
residences, as this is what an average family might reside in.
<strong>SOURCE</strong> Our source was: Office of Policy Development and
Research. (n.d.). 50th percentile rent estimates: HUD USER. 50th
Percentile Rent Estimates | HUD USER. Retrieved December 5, 2022, from
<a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/50per.html#2018"
class="uri">https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/50per.html#2018</a>
. We included a map below to understand and visualuze the regions of the
United States that we were testing with this data. Some unusual factors
that must be acknowledged that will affect the data are the various
natural disasters that have taken place in the past 20 years (such as
Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Maria), stock market downturns, as well
as the COVID-19 pandemic, since all 3 affect the economy and therefore
affect housing costs. We intend to analyze these different datasets by
organizing them into separate datasets based on each year (and the rent
price of each state that year), and then combining them into a single
data set grouping by a new variable, region (the region that each state
lies in) and having that “years” data set show the rent price for each
state in its respective region for each year. The dataset will be used
to create plots depicting the change in rent price and region costs over
year, and we will calculate correlation, p-values, variance, and percent
change of our variables to answer our questions.</p>

<p><strong>Rent Prices By State</strong> Evident from the series of
graphs above, and the key on the side of these graphs, for each year the
average rent price percentile estimate tends to increase across all
parameters, least, medium, and greatest rents. While there are some
subtle differences between each state, this graph is beginning to show
us that the most expensive regions seem to remain the most expensive
regions throughout. However, we will re-look at this later with more
analysis. <strong>Correlation Coefficient Plot</strong> The general
correlation coefficient between the year and rent supports the first
assertion as its value of 0.63 is singnificant and close to 1. The plot
also trends in an almost perfect linear fashion, which shows us
<strong>it is reasonable to assume that rent price increases with the
year</strong>.

<p><strong>Rent Prices by Region</strong> This graph shows the densities
of all the regions shifting to the right, showing that across all the
regions of the US, the rent was increasing, even if to a varying degree
(more of which will be analyzed later). The t-test table shows the
p-value for each period of years and low and high values for the
confidence interval are also labeled. <strong>T-test Table</strong>
Additionally, a t-test was performed for each of the 4 time periods we
have data for. All the p-values were less than 0.05 if using a 95%
confidence interval, indicting that they are all statistically
significant (when comapared to the null hypothesis that the change in
means from year to year is not statistically significant).For 2008-2013,
there was the greatest p-value of 0.03, <strong>indicting that this time
period had the LEAST significant relationship between the change in rent
price and year</strong>. In contrast, 2018-2023 had the smallest p-value
of 0.0003 <strong>showing that there was a MORE significant relationship
between the change in rent price and year</strong>. We can use these
p-values to predict which time period will have the greatest and least
percent change.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The GREATEST percent change from 2003 -&gt; 2023 was in the West with
a magnitude of 105.51%. The LEAST percent change was in the North
Central region: 81.35% (The South was the 2nd greatest, followed by the
Northeast) Similar to above, West led with: 36.28% and North Central
lagged with: 17.44% (However, this time the Northeast was the 2nd
greatest while the South followed). The significance of testing this
specific time period is that this was the period of greatest change in
rent price across the US.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="Idea_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As evidenced by the box plot, the Northeast region consistently had
the greatest mean rent across these time periods. However, it did not
have the greatest percent change from the periods we test. In fact, the
West had the greatest percent change from both 2018-2023, and 2003-2023.
This trend makes sense, as the West’s housing prices grow the greatest
amount, even visually, starting out near the other 2 regions’ prices in
2003 (South and North Central), and surpassing them to rival the
Northeast in 2023. The West also had the greatest variance in 2023 (the
year of greatest variance in the US), which could support that its
housing market has grown the fastest. It is also visually obvious that
NC had the least percent change both across the 2 decade period and
within the last 5 years; it consistently had the cheapest rent prices,
and the least variance. The most expensive year in the US overall (to
date) will be 2023, while the cheapest will be 2003. The greatest change
in housing costs ocurred in the just the past 5 years, which explains
the current housing crisis. To answer our final questions: the Northeast
has always been the most expensive region, and the West follows it,
consistently having been the 2nd most expensive region, but
progressively getting more and more expensive with each decade. North
Central has consistently hosted the cheapest rent prices. And an
abnormal increase in rent prices was seen between 2018-2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This could be due to the covid pandemic and the increasing rate of
economic inflation. It could also be due to earlier natural disasters
such as the CA wildfires or Hurricane Maria. Even international
disasters and the international economy could play a significant role in
the US economy (ex. 2018 Indonesian tsunami &amp; earthquake). There was
also a significant change from 2003-2008 (about 5% less than 2013-2018),
which the economic downturn of 2002 could have played a role in. Some
shortcoming of this analysis are that we don’t know what the cause of
the increasing rent prices between years are, we can only speculate. For
instance, we don’t know the inflation or per capita wage rate changes
over there years, and if those changes paralleled the change in housing
costs then our conclusion about the cause of the housing crisis being
the rapid rate of increase of housing costs in some regions would be
inaccurate. We also look at regions as a whole, but there might be some
states, like NY or CA in their respective regions that have a greater
influence than other states due to a larger population and pricier
residences, which can be misleading when analyzing the entire region.In
the future we could consider looking at more specific time periods and
comparing them to the economic affectors of that time (such as percent
change in inflation rates versus percent change in housing costs), so we
could get an idea of the correlation between an event and the change in
housing prices. We could also look at individual states instead of
regions. Due to the percent changes derived from the medians of the
regions across the US for these different years, we determined that the
Northeast is the most expensive region to live, the North Central is the
least expensive region to live in, and the housing costs abnormally
fluctuated the most between 2019-2023. However, the housing market has
shown the greatest abnormal growth in the west, and the least growth in
North Central.</p>
